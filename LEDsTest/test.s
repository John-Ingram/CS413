@ File: BlinkingLED3A.s
@ Author: R. Kevin Preston
@ Purpose: Provide enough assembly to allow students to complete an assignment. 
@          This code turns the four LEDs on then off several times. The LEDs are
@          connected to the GPIO on the Raspberry Pi. The details on the 
@          hardware and GPIO interface are in another document. 
@
@ Rev  Date        Purpose of change
@ ---  ----        -----------------
@  A   3-Mar-2020  Change the way the LEDs blink and document
@                  the colors of the LEDs on the board in the lab. 
@
@ Use these commands to assemble, link and run the program
@   First run the following to get superuser access. 
@   "sudo su" is the command to allow running without having to
@    use sudo. 
@
@  as -o BlinkingLED3A.o BlinkingLED3A.s
@  gcc -o BlinkingLED3A BlinkingLED3A.o -lwiringPi
@  ./BlinkingLED3A  !! Have to run under sudo su or proceed with sudo. 
@ 
@ gdb --args ./BlinkingLED3A !! Have to run under "sudo su". 
@
@ Define the constants for this code. 

OUTPUT = 1 @ Used to set the selected GPIO pins to output only. 
ON     = 1 @ Turn the LED on.
OFF    = 0 @ Turn the LED off.

RED    = 5 @ Pin number from wiringPi for red led
YELLOW = 4 @ Pin number from wiringPi for yellow led
GREEN  = 3 @ Pin number from wiringPi for green led
BLUE   = 2 @ Pin number from wiringPi for blue led
