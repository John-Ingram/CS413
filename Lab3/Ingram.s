@ Description: This program will simulate the operation of a vending machine. The machine will dispense,
@ upon reception of the correct amount of money, a choice of Gum, Peanuts, Cheese Crackers, or
@ M&Ms. Your software will perform the following:
@ 1. Display a welcome message and instructions.
@ 2. Set the initial inventory to two (2) of each kind.
@ 3. Prompt the user for item selection. Gum (G), Peanuts (P), Cheese Crackers (C), or
@ M&Ms (M). Reject any invalid selections.
@ 4. Confirm the customerâ€™s selection.
@ 5. Prompt the user for the amount to enter: Gum ($0.50), Peanuts ($0.55), Cheese Crackers
@ ($0.65), or M&Ms ($1.00).
@ 6. Accept money inputs of dimes (D), quarters (Q), and one-dollar bills (B).
@ 7. If the customer selects an out of inventory item, prompt them to make another selection.
@ 8. Vending machine will shut down if the entire inventory reaches zero.
@ 9. Assume there is no limit on the amount of change the vending machine contains.
@ 10. Make provisions for a secret code that when entered will display the current inventory of
@ items

.global printf
@  To use printf:
@     r0 - Contains the starting address of the string to be printed. The string
@          must conform to the C coding standards.
@     r1 - If the string contains an output parameter i.e., %d, %c, etc. register
@          r1 must contain the value to be printed. 
@ When the call returns registers: r0, r1, r2, r3 and r12 are changed. 

.global scanf
@  To use scanf:
@      r0 - Contains the address of the input format string used to read the user
@           input value. In this example it is numInputPattern.  
@      r1 - Must contain the address where the input value is going to be stored.
@           In this example memory location intInput declared in the .data section
@           is being used.  
@ When the call returns registers: r0, r1, r2, r3 and r12 are changed.
@ Important Notes about scanf:
@   If the user entered an input that does NOT conform to the input pattern, 
@   then register r0 will contain a 0. If it is a valid format
@   then r0 will contain a 1. The input buffer will NOT be cleared of the invalid
@   input so that needs to be cleared out before attempting anything else.
@
@ Additional notes about scanf and the input patterns:
@    1. If the pattern is %s or %c it is not possible for the user input to generate
@       and error code. Anything that can be typed by the user on the keyboard
@       will be accepted by these two input patterns. 
@    2. If the pattern is %d and the user input 12.123 scanf will accept the 12 as
@       valid input and leave the .123 in the input buffer. 
@    3. If the pattern is "%c" any white space characters are left in the input
@       buffer. In most cases user entered carrage return remains in the input buffer
@       and if you do another scanf with "%c" the carrage return will be returned. 
@       To ignore these "white" characters use " $c" as the input pattern. This will
@       ignore any of these non-printing characters the user may have entered.
